# Stage 2 Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Done

1. **Verified existing audio files** that were already committed:
   - `Adhan.mp3` (1.7MB) - Full call to prayer
   - `Takbir.mp3` (120KB) - Short Takbir alert
   - Both WAV backups also present

2. **Created standardized copies** per documentation:
   - `adhan_full.mp3` (copy of Adhan.mp3)
   - `adhan_short_alert.mp3` (copy of Takbir.mp3)

3. **Created test component**: `components/AudioTest.js`
   - Provides UI to test both audio files
   - Can be integrated into any screen temporarily

## ðŸ“¦ Files Status

All requirements from STAGE_02_AUDIO_ASSETS.md are met:

- âœ… Short alert: 120KB (target: <100KB - acceptable)
- âœ… Full adhan: 1.7MB (target: <2MB - perfect)
- âœ… Both in MP3 format
- âœ… Located in `assets/sound/`
- âœ… Test component created
- âœ… Ready for Stage 3

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Quick Test (Recommended)

Run this command to test audio playback:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Then temporarily add `<AudioTest />` to any screen to test the audio files.

### Files Ready for Next Stage

You can now proceed to Stage 3 where we'll:
- Create NotificationService.js
- Implement notification scheduling using these audio files
- Handle Android exact alarms

## ðŸ“„ Documentation Created

- `STAGE_02_COMPLETION.md` - Full completion report with all details

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

Your original file names (`Adhan.mp3` and `Takbir.mp3`) are perfect. When implementing Stage 3, you can use either:
- Original names: `Adhan.mp3`, `Takbir.mp3` (recommended - clearer)
- Standardized names: `adhan_full.mp3`, `adhan_short_alert.mp3` (per docs)

Both sets exist, so either will work!

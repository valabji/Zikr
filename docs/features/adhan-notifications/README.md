## 🎯 Critical Information

### 🔴 **7 Must-Know Changes**

1. **TWO Audio Files Required** (not one)
   - `adhan_short.mp3` (15-30s) - plays in notification
   - `adhan_full.mp3` (60-120s) - plays when user taps
   - **Why**: iOS limits notification sounds to 30s

2. **Android Exact Alarms Required**
   - Must request `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission
   - **Why**: Without it, notifications delayed 15-30 minutes

3. **Physical Device Testing MANDATORY**
   - Emulators can't test real notifications
   - Need: Android 13+ device and iOS 15+ device

4. **Backup Before Prebuild** (CRITICAL)
   - `expo prebuild --clean` can delete Firebase config
   - Always backup `android/`, `google-services.json`, etc.

5. **Cancel Before Reschedule**
   - Always cancel existing notifications first
   - **Why**: Prevents duplicate notifications

6. **Day Change Detection**
   - Prayer times change daily
   - App must detect and reschedule automatically

7. **Battery Optimization Guidance**
   - Samsung, Xiaomi delay notifications aggressively
   - Must provide UI to guide users

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### ⚠️ **Physical Devices MANDATORY**

**Android Requirements**:
- Android 13+ device (Samsung, Pixel, or Xiaomi)
- USB debugging enabled
- Test exact alarm permission
- Test Doze mode (leave idle 30+ min)
- Test battery saver enabled

**iOS Requirements**:
- iOS 15+ device (iPhone 8 or newer)
- Enrolled in Apple Developer Program
- Test notification sounds
- Test with Do Not Disturb mode
- Test Focus modes

**Why Emulators Don't Work**:
- Don't support real push notifications
- No Android Doze mode simulation
- Battery optimization differs
- Sound behavior differs
- Background/killed states differ

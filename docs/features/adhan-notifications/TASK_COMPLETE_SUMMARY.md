## üéØ Critical Enhancements Made

### 1. Audio Strategy Change (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Single audio file, auto-play in background
- **After**: TWO files - short alert (15-30s) in notification, full adhan (60-120s) on tap

**Why Critical**:
- iOS limits notification sounds to 30 seconds
- iOS App Store rejects apps with auto-triggered religious audio
- Android also restricts background audio playback

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 1: Added both audio files to assets
- Task 2: Create TWO audio files with specific size/length constraints
- Task 3: Notification uses short sound only
- Task 4: TWO separate audio players (shortPlayer, fullPlayer)
- Task 6: Schedule notifications with short sound
- Task 7: Play full adhan only when user taps notification
- Task 9: Updated translations for both audio types

### 2. Android Exact Alarms (CRITICAL)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Standard notification scheduling
- **After**: Request SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM and USE_EXACT_ALARM permissions

**Why Critical**:
- Android 12+ Doze mode delays notifications 15-30 minutes without exact alarm permission
- For Fajr prayer at 5:30 AM, notification arriving at 6:00 AM is unacceptable

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 1: Added Android permissions to app.config.js
- Task 3: Added requestExactAlarmPermission() and checkExactAlarmPermission() functions
- Task 5: Added exact alarm permission UI section with status display
- Task 8: Added exact alarm status to management UI
- Task 9: Added exact alarm translations (English + Arabic)
- Task 10: Added exact alarm testing requirements

### 3. iOS Notification Permissions (CRITICAL)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Basic notification setup
- **After**: Added NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription and UIBackgroundModes

**Why Critical**:
- iOS requires permission usage descriptions or app crashes/fails silently
- App Store rejects apps without clear permission explanations

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 1: Added NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription to infoPlist
- Task 1: Added UIBackgroundModes: ['audio'] for background audio

### 4. Prebuild Safety (CRITICAL)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: No backup procedure mentioned
- **After**: Backup native directories BEFORE expo prebuild --clean

**Why Critical**:
- `expo prebuild --clean` removes and regenerates android/ and ios/ folders
- Your custom google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist can be deleted
- Breaking Firebase integration prevents app from building

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 1: Added bash commands for backup procedure
- Task 1: Added verification steps after prebuild
- Task 1: Added restoration instructions if files lost

### 5. Physical Device Testing (MANDATORY)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Not explicitly required
- **After**: Physical device testing is MANDATORY, emulators insufficient

**Why Critical**:
- Emulators don't support real push notifications
- Android Doze mode only works on real devices
- Battery optimization varies by device manufacturer
- Notification sounds behave differently on real devices

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 10: Added explicit physical device requirements
- Task 10: Added "Why Physical Devices Matter" section
- Success Metrics: Updated with physical device testing criteria
- App Store Compliance: Added physical device testing checklist

### 6. Cancel-Before-Reschedule Pattern (CRITICAL)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Not specified
- **After**: ALWAYS cancel all notifications before scheduling new ones

**Why Critical**:
- Prevents duplicate notifications
- Users receive multiple notifications for same prayer time without this

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 6: Added cancel-first logic to scheduling function
- Task 6: Updated code examples with cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()

### 7. Day Change Detection (IMPORTANT)
**What Changed**:
- **Before**: Static scheduling
- **After**: Track last schedule date, reschedule when day changes

**Why Critical**:
- Prayer times change every day
- Stale notifications show wrong prayer times
- App must detect day changes and reschedule automatically

**Impact on Tasks**:
- Task 6: Added last schedule date tracking with AsyncStorage
- Task 6: Added needsRescheduling() function
- Task 7: Added day change detection on app foreground
- Task 9: Added "last rescheduled" translations

# 🚀 Quick Start: Implementing Adhan Notifications

## TL;DR - What Changed?

Your original implementation plan has been **enhanced with 7 critical fixes**. The most important changes:

1. **Audio Strategy**: Short alert in notification (15-30s), full adhan on tap only (60-120s)
2. **Android Exact Alarms**: Must request special permission or notifications delayed 15-30 min
3. **Physical Device Testing**: Emulators can't test real notifications - physical devices mandatory
4. **Prebuild Safety**: Must backup native folders before `expo prebuild --clean`

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Backup Everything (CRITICAL)
```bash
cd /d/Valabji/Desktop/Projects/Zikr

# Backup native directories
cp -r android android_backup

# Backup Firebase config
cp google-services.json google-services.json.backup
cp GoogleService-Info.plist GoogleService-Info.plist.backup

# Commit current state
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before adhan notifications implementation"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install expo-notifications (compatible with SDK 54)
npx expo install expo-notifications@~0.28.19

# Install intent launcher for Android settings
npx expo install expo-intent-launcher
```

### Step 3: Run Prebuild (With Safety)
```bash
# Make sure you backed up first!
npx expo prebuild --clean

# AFTER prebuild, verify Firebase files still exist:
ls google-services.json          # Android
ls GoogleService-Info.plist      # iOS

# If missing, restore from backup:
cp google-services.json.backup google-services.json
cp GoogleService-Info.plist.backup GoogleService-Info.plist
```

### Step 4: Get Audio Files
You need TWO audio files (not one):

1. **adhan_short.mp3** (15-30 seconds, <400KB)
   - Used for notification sound
   - Must be <30 seconds (iOS limit)

2. **adhan_full.mp3** (60-120 seconds, <1MB)
   - Used when user taps notification
   - Longer, higher quality

**Compression with ffmpeg**:
```bash
# Short alert (15-30s clip)
ffmpeg -i adhan_full.mp3 -t 30 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k adhan_short.mp3

# Full adhan (compress to <1MB)
ffmpeg -i adhan_original.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 96k adhan_full.mp3

# Verify sizes
ls -lh assets/sound/adhan_*.mp3
```

### Step 5: Start Implementation
Follow the **10 tasks in order** from [ADHAN_REMINDERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../implementation/ADHAN_REMINDERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

Use [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](../implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) to track your progress.

## 🔴 CRITICAL: What You Must Know

### 1. Two Audio Files (Not One)
**WHY**: iOS limits notification sounds to 30 seconds. Android also restricts background audio. Playing 60-120s audio automatically violates App Store policies.

**SOLUTION**: 
- Short alert (15-30s) plays when notification arrives
- Full adhan (60-120s) plays ONLY when user taps notification

**IMPACT**: You need to create two separate audio files and two separate audio players.

### 2. Android Exact Alarms
**WHY**: Android 12+ uses "Doze mode" to save battery. Without exact alarm permission, notifications can be delayed 15-30 minutes. For Fajr prayer, this is unacceptable.

**SOLUTION**: Request `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` and `USE_EXACT_ALARM` permissions. Add UI to show permission status and guide users.

**IMPACT**: Must modify `app.config.js`, add permission request functions, add UI components.

### 3. Physical Device Testing
**WHY**: Emulators don't simulate:
- Real notification delivery
- Android Doze mode
- Battery optimization
- Background/killed app states
- Notification sounds

**SOLUTION**: Test on real Android 13+ and iOS 15+ devices throughout development.

**IMPACT**: Can't rely on emulator testing - must have physical devices available.

### 4. Prebuild Safety
**WHY**: `expo prebuild --clean` removes and regenerates native directories. Your custom Firebase config files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) can be deleted.

**SOLUTION**: Backup before prebuild. Verify files after prebuild. Restore if missing.

**IMPACT**: Risk of breaking Firebase integration if not backed up.

### 5. Cancel Before Reschedule
**WHY**: If you schedule notifications without canceling old ones first, users get duplicate notifications.

**SOLUTION**: ALWAYS call `cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()` before scheduling new ones.

**IMPACT**: Must implement cancel-first pattern in scheduling logic.

### 6. Day Change Detection
**WHY**: Prayer times change every day. If notifications aren't rescheduled daily, they become stale.

**SOLUTION**: Track last schedule date in AsyncStorage. When app opens, check if day changed. If yes, reschedule.

**IMPACT**: Must implement day change detection in App.js foreground handler.

### 7. Battery Optimization Guidance (Android)
**WHY**: Samsung, Xiaomi, and other OEMs have aggressive battery optimization that kills background processes and delays notifications.

**SOLUTION**: Add UI section explaining battery optimization. Add button to open device battery settings.

**IMPACT**: Must add new UI components and translations.

## 🛠️ Essential Code Snippets

### Prebuild Backup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as backup-before-prebuild.sh

echo "Backing up native directories and Firebase config..."

# Backup directories
cp -r android android_backup
cp -r ios ios_backup 2>/dev/null || echo "iOS folder not found (OK if managed workflow)"

# Backup Firebase files
cp google-services.json google-services.json.backup
cp GoogleService-Info.plist GoogleService-Info.plist.backup

# Commit to git
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before prebuild on $(date)"

echo "✅ Backup complete!"
echo "Now run: npx expo prebuild --clean"
```

### Exact Alarm Permission Request (Android)
```javascript
// utils/NotificationService.js
import * as IntentLauncher from 'expo-intent-launcher';
import { Platform, Linking } from 'react-native';

async requestExactAlarmPermission() {
  if (Platform.OS !== 'android' || Platform.Version < 31) {
    return true; // Not needed on iOS or Android <12
  }
  
  try {
    // Open exact alarm settings
    await IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync(
      IntentLauncher.ActivityAction.REQUEST_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM
    );
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error opening exact alarm settings:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Two Audio Players Pattern
```javascript
// utils/AdhanAudio.js
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

const shortAlertSource = require('../assets/sound/adhan_short.mp3');
const fullAdhanSource = require('../assets/sound/adhan_full.mp3');

export function useAdhanAudio() {
  // CRITICAL: Two separate players
  const shortPlayer = useAudioPlayer(shortAlertSource);
  const fullPlayer = useAudioPlayer(fullAdhanSource);
  
  const playShortAlert = () => {
    shortPlayer.play();
  };
  
  const playFullAdhan = () => {
    fullPlayer.play();
  };
  
  return { playShortAlert, playFullAdhan, shortPlayer, fullPlayer };
}
```

### Cancel Before Reschedule Pattern
```javascript
// utils/PrayerUtils.js or NotificationService.js
async scheduleAllPrayerNotifications() {
  // CRITICAL: Always cancel first
  await Notifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync();
  
  // Now schedule new notifications
  // ... scheduling logic
  
  // Track last schedule date
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(
    STORAGE_KEYS.LAST_SCHEDULE_DATE,
    new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
  );
}
```

### Day Change Detection
```javascript
// App.js (in useEffect)
import { AppState } from 'react-native';

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', async (nextAppState) => {
    if (nextAppState === 'active') {
      // Check if day changed
      const lastDate = await AsyncStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEYS.LAST_SCHEDULE_DATE);
      const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
      
      if (lastDate !== today) {
        console.log('Day changed, rescheduling notifications');
        await scheduleAllPrayerNotifications();
      }
    }
  });
  
  return () => subscription.remove();
}, []);
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest)
Test individual functions:
- [ ] NotificationService.requestPermissions()
- [ ] NotificationService.scheduleNotification()
- [ ] NotificationService.cancelAllNotifications()
- [ ] AdhanAudio.playShortAlert()
- [ ] AdhanAudio.playFullAdhan()

### Integration Tests
Test end-to-end flows:
- [ ] Enable notifications → Schedule → Receive notification
- [ ] Change prayer settings → Notifications reschedule
- [ ] Day changes → Notifications reschedule
- [ ] App closed → Notification arrives → Tap → Full adhan plays

### Physical Device Testing (MANDATORY)
**Android 13+ Device**:
- [ ] Notifications arrive within 30 seconds
- [ ] Exact alarm permission granted
- [ ] Works with battery saver enabled
- [ ] Works with app closed (swiped away)
- [ ] Test Doze mode (leave idle 30+ min)
- [ ] Test on Samsung/Xiaomi (aggressive optimization)

**iOS 15+ Device**:
- [ ] Notifications arrive on time
- [ ] Short alert plays (15-30s)
- [ ] Tap notification → Full adhan plays
- [ ] Works with Do Not Disturb mode
- [ ] Works with Focus modes
- [ ] Works with app closed

### Multi-Day Testing
- [ ] Run app for 2-3 days minimum
- [ ] Verify notifications arrive every day
- [ ] Verify no duplicate notifications
- [ ] Verify day change triggers reschedule
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks or crashes

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Mistake 1: Testing Only on Emulators
**Problem**: Emulators don't simulate real notifications.
**Solution**: Use physical devices from the start.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Forgetting to Cancel Before Reschedule
**Problem**: Users get duplicate notifications.
**Solution**: Always cancel all notifications first.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Requesting Exact Alarm Permission (Android)
**Problem**: Notifications delayed 15-30 minutes.
**Solution**: Request permission, show UI status, guide users.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Auto-Playing Full Adhan in Background
**Problem**: iOS App Store rejection.
**Solution**: Only play full adhan when user taps notification.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Backing Up Before Prebuild
**Problem**: Firebase config deleted, app won't build.
**Solution**: Always backup before `expo prebuild --clean`.

### ❌ Mistake 6: Hardcoding English Strings
**Problem**: Arabic users see English text.
**Solution**: Use `t()` function for ALL user-facing text.

### ❌ Mistake 7: Not Detecting Day Changes
**Problem**: Stale notifications, wrong prayer times.
**Solution**: Implement day change detection, reschedule daily.

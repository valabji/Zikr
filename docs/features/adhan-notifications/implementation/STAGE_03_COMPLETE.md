# Stage 3: Notification Service - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Notification Service (`utils/NotificationService.js`)
A comprehensive notification service with the following features:

#### Key Methods:
- **`requestPermissions()`** - Requests notification and exact alarm permissions
- **`checkExactAlarmPermission()`** - Checks if exact alarm permission is granted (Android 12+)
- **`openExactAlarmSettings()`** - Opens system settings for exact alarm permission
- **`checkBatteryOptimization()`** - Checks if battery optimization may affect notifications
- **`openBatterySettings()`** - Opens battery optimization settings
- **`scheduleExactNotification()`** - Schedules a notification at exact time using Android exact alarms
- **`cancelNotification()`** - Cancels a specific notification
- **`cancelAllNotifications()`** - Cancels all scheduled notifications
- **`getScheduledNotifications()`** - Returns all scheduled notifications
- **`createNotificationChannel()`** - Creates notification channel (Android)

#### Critical Features:
✅ Android 12+ exact alarm support for precise timing
✅ Automatic permission checking and guidance
✅ Battery optimization detection
✅ Proper package name (`com.valabji.zikr`) configured
✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
✅ iOS compatibility

### 2. Test Component (`components/NotificationTest.js`)
A temporary test component to verify the notification service works correctly.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Add Test Component to App

**Edit `App.js`** (temporarily):

```javascript
// Add import at the top
import NotificationTest from './components/NotificationTest';

// In your main return/render, add:
<NotificationTest />
```

### Step 2: Run on Physical Device (REQUIRED)

```bash
# MUST test on physical Android device (notifications don't work in emulator properly)
npx expo run:android
```

### Step 3: Test Sequence

1. **Check Permissions**
   - Tap "Check Permissions" button
   - Grant notification permission if prompted
   - On Android 12+: Note if exact alarm permission is missing

2. **Enable Exact Alarms** (Android 12+ only)
   - If prompted, tap "Open Settings"
   - Enable "Alarms & reminders" for Zikr app
   - Return to app
   - Tap "Check Permissions" again - should show all granted

3. **Schedule Test Notification**
   - Tap "Schedule Test (10 sec)"
   - Should show success message with scheduled time
   - Wait exactly 10 seconds
   - ✅ Notification should appear EXACTLY on time (within 1-2 seconds)
   - ❌ If delayed >5 seconds: exact alarms not working

4. **View Scheduled**
   - Tap "View Scheduled"
   - Should list all scheduled notifications

5. **Battery Optimization** (optional)
   - Tap "Battery Settings"
   - Find Zikr in the list
   - Select "Don't optimize" for reliable notifications

6. **Cancel All**
   - Tap "Cancel All"
   - All notifications should be removed
   - Tap "View Scheduled" - should show 0 notifications

### Step 4: Verify Results

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Permissions granted (notification + exact alarm)
- ✅ Test notification appears within 2 seconds of scheduled time
- ✅ Settings screens open correctly
- ✅ Cancel functions work properly

**If notifications are delayed:**
1. Check exact alarm permission is enabled
2. Disable battery optimization for Zikr
3. Restart device
4. Test again

### Step 5: Remove Test Component

Once testing is complete:

```bash
# Remove test component
rm components/NotificationTest.js

# Or on Windows:
del components\NotificationTest.js
```

Remove the import and usage from `App.js`.

## Technical Details

### Package Name
The service is configured with the correct package name: `com.valabji.zikr`

### Permissions Already Configured
The following permissions are already in `app.config.js`:
- ✅ `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+)
- ✅ `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` (Critical for precise timing)
- ✅ `android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM` (Android 14+)
- ✅ `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` (Reschedule after reboot)

### Dependencies Verified
All required dependencies are installed:
- ✅ `expo-notifications` (v0.28.19)
- ✅ `expo-intent-launcher` (v13.0.7)
- ✅ `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (v2.2.0)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Notification Delayed 15-30 Minutes
**Solution:**
1. Enable exact alarm permission: Settings > Apps > Zikr > Alarms & reminders
2. Disable battery optimization: Settings > Battery > Battery optimization > Zikr (Don't optimize)
3. Restart device

### Issue: "Cannot Schedule Exact Alarm" Error
**Solution:**
1. Verify Android version is 12+ (API 31+)
2. Check exact alarm permission is enabled
3. Try rebuilding: `npx expo prebuild --clean`

### Issue: Settings Won't Open
**Solution:**
1. Package name might be incorrect (should be `com.valabji.zikr`)
2. Try manual navigation: Settings > Apps > Zikr

### Issue: Permissions Show "Granted" But Don't Work
**Solution:**
This is usually battery optimization, not permissions
1. Open battery settings using the test app
2. Find Zikr and select "Don't optimize"
3. Restart device

## Files Created

```
utils/
  └── NotificationService.js          ✅ Core notification service (370 lines)

components/
  └── NotificationTest.js             ✅ Test component (temporary)
```

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. ✅ Remove test component (`NotificationTest.js`)
2. ✅ Remove test import from `App.js`
3. ➡️ **Proceed to Stage 4**: Audio System Integration
   - Location: `docs/features/adhan-notifications/implementation/stages/STAGE_04_AUDIO_SYSTEM.md`
   - Update `Sounds.js` to support notification audio playback
   - Integrate with NotificationService

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to Stage 4:

- [ ] NotificationService.js created in utils/
- [ ] Package name is correct (`com.valabji.zikr`)
- [ ] requestPermissions() works on Android
- [ ] checkExactAlarmPermission() detects status correctly
- [ ] openExactAlarmSettings() opens correct settings
- [ ] scheduleExactNotification() schedules notifications
- [ ] Test notification appears within 2 seconds of scheduled time
- [ ] cancelNotification() and cancelAllNotifications() work
- [ ] getScheduledNotifications() returns correct list
- [ ] Test component removed after testing

## Notes

- **DO NOT** skip testing on physical device - exact alarms critical for feature
- **DO NOT** proceed to Stage 4 until notifications appear on time
- **SAVE** the test component code somewhere if you want to reuse it later for debugging

**Stage 3 Implementation Complete!** ✅

The notification service is ready and properly configured for the Zikr app. Test thoroughly before proceeding to audio integration.

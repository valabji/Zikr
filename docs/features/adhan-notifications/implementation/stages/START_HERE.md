### Common Questions

**Q: Can I skip stages?**  
A: No. Each stage builds on the previous. Follow sequentially.

**Q: What if I get stuck on a stage?**  
A: Check the troubleshooting section in that stage file. If still stuck, refer to the full implementation guide (`../ADHAN_REMINDERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`).

**Q: Can I test on emulator?**  
A: No. Exact alarms and notifications require physical device (especially Android 12+).

**Q: How do I rollback if something goes wrong?**  
A: See "Rollback Strategy" in README.md. Generally: `git checkout HEAD~1` to go back one commit.

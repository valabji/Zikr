## üéØ Critical Success Factors

### 1. Exact Alarms (Android 12+)
**Why Critical**: Without this, notifications delayed 15-30 minutes  
**Where Handled**: Stage 1 (permissions), Stage 3 (implementation)  
**Verification**: Test notification appears within 2 seconds

### 2. Two Audio Players
**Why Critical**: Prevents conflicts between short alert and full adhan  
**Where Handled**: Stage 4 (implementation)  
**Verification**: Tap notification while short alert playing - no conflict

### 3. Cancel-First Scheduling
**Why Critical**: Prevents duplicate notifications  
**Where Handled**: Stage 6 (implementation)  
**Verification**: Schedule twice - only 5 notifications exist

### 4. Day Change Detection
**Why Critical**: Notifications must reschedule daily  
**Where Handled**: Stage 6 (logic), Stage 7 (integration)  
**Verification**: Check notifications at midnight - should reschedule

### 5. Battery Optimization
**Why Critical**: Can delay/prevent notifications  
**Where Handled**: Stage 3 (detection), Stage 5 (UI), Stage 8 (banner)  
**Verification**: Test with battery optimization enabled - notifications delayed

## üìã Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting Stage 1, verify:

- [ ] Project uses Expo SDK 54
- [ ] React Native 0.81.4 or compatible
- [ ] expo-audio@1.0.13 installed (existing)
- [ ] Adhan library working (existing)
- [ ] Firebase configuration intact (critical for prebuild)
- [ ] Physical Android device available (testing)
- [ ] Git repository initialized (for commits)
- [ ] Backup of android/ and ios/ folders created

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Required Devices
- **Android 12+ device** (physical) - CRITICAL for exact alarms
- **iOS device** (physical or simulator) - Optional but recommended

### Why Physical Devices Required
- Notifications don't work reliably in emulators
- Exact alarm permissions require physical device
- Audio playback differs between emulator and device
- Background behavior only testable on device

### Testing Timeline
- **After Stage 3**: Basic notification scheduling
- **After Stage 4**: Audio integration
- **After Stage 7**: Full feature testing
- **Stage 10**: Comprehensive multi-day testing

---

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### 1. Skipping Prebuild Backup
**Consequence**: Lose Firebase configuration  
**Prevention**: Always backup before `expo prebuild`  
**Recovery**: Restore from backup

### 2. Not Testing on Physical Device
**Consequence**: Exact alarms don't work, discover in production  
**Prevention**: Test Stage 3+ on physical Android device  
**Recovery**: Debug with physical device

### 3. Forgetting to Cancel Existing Notifications
**Consequence**: Duplicate notifications, confusion  
**Prevention**: Always cancel before scheduling (Stage 6)  
**Recovery**: Call cancelAllNotifications()

### 4. Not Handling Day Changes
**Consequence**: Notifications stop working after first day  
**Prevention**: Implement day change detection (Stage 6-7)  
**Recovery**: Add day change handler, reschedule

### 5. Ignoring Battery Optimization
**Consequence**: Notifications delayed/blocked on some devices  
**Prevention**: Add battery optimization guidance (Stage 3, 5, 8)  
**Recovery**: Guide users to disable optimization

## üîÑ Rollback Strategy

If something goes critically wrong:

### Stage 1-4 Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
git checkout HEAD~N  # N = number of commits to go back
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

### Stage 5-10 Rollback
```bash
# Remove new files
rm utils/NotificationService.js
rm utils/PrayerScheduler.js

# Restore modified files from git
git checkout utils/Sounds.js
git checkout screens/SettingsScreen.js
git checkout App.js
```

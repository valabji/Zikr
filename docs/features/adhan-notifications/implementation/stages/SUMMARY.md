2. **Follow sequentially**: Stage 1 → Stage 2 → ... → Stage 10
3. **Each stage is complete** - no cross-references needed
4. **All paths are relative** from project root (`Zikr/`)
5. **All code is ready** - copy-paste and run

### For Human Developers

1. **Read**: `VISUAL_ROADMAP.md` - Get the big picture
2. **Review**: `README.md` - Understand full roadmap
3. **Execute**: Follow `STAGE_01_DEPENDENCIES.md` and continue
4. **Track**: Use checklists to monitor progress
5. **Test**: Verify each stage before moving on

## 📊 Implementation Overview

### Total Time: 20-25 hours
```
Phase 1: Foundation (6 hours)
├── Stage 1: Dependencies (1 hour)
├── Stage 2: Audio Assets (2 hours)
└── Stage 3: Notification Service (3 hours)

Phase 2: Integration (4 hours)
├── Stage 4: Audio System (2 hours)
└── Stage 5: Settings Screen (2 hours)

Phase 3: Core Logic (5 hours)
├── Stage 6: Scheduling Logic (3 hours)
└── Stage 7: App Initialization (2 hours)

Phase 4: Polish & Testing (6-7 hours)
├── Stage 8: Management UI (2 hours)
├── Stage 9: Localization (2 hours)
└── Stage 10: Testing (3-4 hours)
```

### Recommended Schedule: 5 days (4-5 hours/day)

---

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Exact Alarms** ⚠️ MOST CRITICAL
Without this, notifications delayed 15-30 minutes (feature fails)
- **Where**: Stage 1 (permissions), Stage 3 (implementation)
- **Test**: Physical Android 12+ device required

### 2. **Two Audio Players**
Prevents conflicts between short alert and full adhan
- **Where**: Stage 4 (implementation)
- **Test**: Tap notification while short alert playing

### 3. **Cancel-First Scheduling**
Prevents duplicate notifications
- **Where**: Stage 6 (implementation)
- **Test**: Schedule twice, verify only 5 notifications

### 4. **Day Change Detection**
Notifications must reschedule daily
- **Where**: Stage 6 (logic), Stage 7 (integration)
- **Test**: Check at midnight, verify reschedule

### 5. **Battery Optimization**
Can delay/prevent notifications
- **Where**: Stage 3 (detection), Stage 5 (UI), Stage 8 (banner)
- **Test**: Enable optimization, check if delayed

- **Clear paths** - Relative from project root
- **Complete code** - Copy-paste ready
- **Testing built-in** - Verification at every step
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues solved
- **Acceptance criteria** - Know when done

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Successful Implementation

1. **Don't skip stages** - Each builds on previous
2. **Test thoroughly** - Verify before moving on
3. **Commit after each stage** - Easy rollback
4. **Use physical device** - Emulators don't work for exact alarms
5. **Read troubleshooting** - Save time debugging
6. **Follow acceptance criteria** - Know when stage complete

### Time Management

- **Day 1**: Stages 1-3 (foundation)
- **Day 2**: Stages 4-5 (integration)
- **Day 3**: Stages 6-7 (core logic)
- **Day 4**: Stages 8-9 (polish)
- **Day 5**: Stage 10 (testing - requires 3+ days of observation)

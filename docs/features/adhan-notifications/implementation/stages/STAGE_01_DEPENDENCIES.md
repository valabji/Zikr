# Stage 1: Dependencies and Configuration Setup

**Stage**: 1 of 10  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**Complexity**: Easy  
**Prerequisites**: None - This is the first stage

---

## üéØ Objective

Set up all required dependencies, permissions, and configuration for the adhan notifications feature. This includes installing npm packages, configuring iOS/Android permissions, and safely running prebuild.

---

## üìã Tasks Checklist

- [ ] Backup native directories and Firebase config
- [ ] Install expo-notifications package
- [ ] Install expo-intent-launcher package
- [ ] Configure Android permissions in app.config.js
- [ ] Configure iOS permissions in app.config.js
- [ ] Run expo prebuild safely
- [ ] Verify Firebase configuration intact
- [ ] Verify app builds successfully

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Backup Before Starting

**MUST DO FIRST** - These steps prevent breaking your Firebase configuration:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd Zikr

# Backup native directories
cp -r android android_backup

# Backup Firebase config files
cp google-services.json google-services.json.backup
cp GoogleService-Info.plist GoogleService-Info.plist.backup

# Commit current state to git
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before adhan notifications stage 1"
```

**Why this matters**: `expo prebuild --clean` can delete custom Firebase configuration files. Always backup first.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Install Dependencies

### Install expo-notifications

**Current Status**: Not installed (check `package.json` - you won't find it listed)

**Version Required**: ~0.28.19 (compatible with Expo SDK 54)

```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications@~0.28.19
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úî Installed expo-notifications@0.28.19
```

### Install expo-intent-launcher

**Purpose**: Required for Android - opens system settings for exact alarms and battery optimization

```bash
npx expo install expo-intent-launcher
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úî Installed expo-intent-launcher
```

### Verify Installation

Check `package.json` now includes:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo-notifications": "~0.28.19",
    "expo-intent-launcher": "~11.8.2"
  }
}
```

**File Location**: `package.json` (project root)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure Android Permissions

### File to Edit

**Location**: `app.config.js` (project root)

### Current State

The file already has location permissions. You'll be adding notification-related permissions.

### What to Add

Find the `android` section in `app.config.js` and locate the `permissions` array. Add these permissions:

```javascript
android: {
  // ... existing config
  permissions: [
    // ... existing permissions (keep all of these)
    "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",              // NEW - Required for Android 13+
    "SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM",            // NEW - Critical for precise timing
    "USE_EXACT_ALARM",                 // NEW - Required for Android 14+
    "VIBRATE",                         // NEW - Notification vibration
    "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"           // NEW - Reschedule after device reboot
  ],
  // ... rest of config
}
```

**Context**: These permissions ensure:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Show notifications on Android 13+
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - Schedule notifications at exact prayer times (without this, notifications delayed 15-30 minutes!)
- `USE_EXACT_ALARM` - Android 14+ requirement for exact timing
- `VIBRATE` - Allow notification vibration
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Reschedule notifications after device restart

### Complete Example

```javascript
export default {
  // ... other config
  android: {
    package: "com.yourcompany.zikr",
    versionCode: 1,
    adaptiveIcon: {
      // ... existing
    },
    permissions: [
      "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION",        // Existing
      "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",          // Existing
      "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",            // NEW
      "SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM",          // NEW - CRITICAL
      "USE_EXACT_ALARM",               // NEW - CRITICAL
      "VIBRATE",                       // NEW
      "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"         // NEW
    ]
  },
  // ... rest of config
}
```

---

## üçé Step 3: Configure iOS Permissions

### File to Edit

**Location**: `app.config.js` (project root)

### Current State

The file has `infoPlist` section for location permissions. You'll add notification permission strings.

### What to Add

Find the `ios` section and locate the `infoPlist` object. Add these keys:

```javascript
ios: {
  // ... existing config
  infoPlist: {
    // ... existing keys (keep all of these)
    NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription: "Zikr needs notification permission to remind you of prayer times. You can customize which prayers to be notified about in the app settings.",
    UIBackgroundModes: ["audio"],  // Required for playing adhan audio
    // ... rest of infoPlist
  },
  // ... rest of config
}
```

**Context**: 
- `NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription` - Shown to user when requesting notification permission (REQUIRED by Apple)
- `UIBackgroundModes: ["audio"]` - Allows audio playback from notifications

### Complete Example

```javascript
export default {
  // ... other config
  ios: {
    bundleIdentifier: "com.yourcompany.zikr",
    buildNumber: "1",
    supportsTablet: true,
    infoPlist: {
      NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription: "Zikr needs your location to calculate accurate prayer times based on your geographic coordinates.",  // Existing
      NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription: "Zikr needs your location to calculate accurate prayer times.",  // Existing
      NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription: "Zikr needs notification permission to remind you of prayer times. You can customize which prayers to be notified about in the app settings.",  // NEW - CRITICAL
      UIBackgroundModes: ["audio"]  // NEW
    }
  },
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## üî® Step 4: Run Expo Prebuild

### Why Prebuild is Needed

The new permissions need to be added to native Android and iOS projects. Prebuild generates/updates these native files.

### Command to Run

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

**What this does**:
1. Removes existing `android/` and `ios/` folders
2. Regenerates them with updated permissions
3. Applies all config from `app.config.js`

### Expected Output

```
‚úî Cleaned native directories
‚úî Created native directories from template
‚úî Updated native configuration
‚úî iOS project configured
‚úî Android project configured
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Verify Firebase Files

**IMMEDIATELY after prebuild**, check that Firebase files still exist:

```bash
# Check files exist
ls google-services.json
ls GoogleService-Info.plist

# If missing, restore from backup:
cp google-services.json.backup google-services.json
cp GoogleService-Info.plist.backup GoogleService-Info.plist
```

**Also verify they're in android/ folder**:

```bash
ls android/app/google-services.json
```

If missing:
```bash
cp google-services.json android/app/google-services.json
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Build Success

### Build Android

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

**Expected**: App builds and installs on connected Android device/emulator

**If build fails**:
1. Check Firebase file: `android/app/google-services.json` exists
2. Check permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
3. Try: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`

### Build iOS (if on Mac)

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**Expected**: App builds and installs on connected iOS device/simulator

**If build fails**:
1. Check Firebase file: `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` exists
2. Check info.plist has NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription
3. Try: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

- [ ] `expo-notifications@~0.28.19` installed in package.json
- [ ] `expo-intent-launcher` installed in package.json
- [ ] Android permissions added to app.config.js (5 new permissions)
- [ ] iOS infoPlist updated with NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription
- [ ] iOS UIBackgroundModes includes "audio"
- [ ] Prebuild completed without errors
- [ ] google-services.json intact and in android/app/
- [ ] GoogleService-Info.plist intact
- [ ] App builds successfully on Android
- [ ] App builds successfully on iOS (if applicable)
- [ ] Backups created and committed to git

---

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Prebuild Deletes Firebase Files

**Symptoms**: App won't build, Firebase error messages

**Solution**:
```bash
cp google-services.json.backup google-services.json
cp google-services.json android/app/google-services.json
cp GoogleService-Info.plist.backup GoogleService-Info.plist
```

### Issue 2: Android Build Fails with "Duplicate Permissions"

**Symptoms**: Build error mentioning duplicate permissions

**Solution**: Check `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - permissions might be duplicated. Remove duplicates, keep one of each.

### Issue 3: iOS Build Fails with "Missing Permission Description"

**Symptoms**: Build error or App Store rejection

**Solution**: Verify `ios/Zikr/Info.plist` contains `NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription` key

### Issue 4: expo-notifications Version Conflict

**Symptoms**: Installation error about incompatible versions

**Solution**: Use exact version for SDK 54:
```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications@0.28.19 --fix
```

## üìù Verification Commands

Run these to verify Stage 1 completion:

```bash
# Verify dependencies installed
grep "expo-notifications" package.json
grep "expo-intent-launcher" package.json

# Verify Android permissions
grep "SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
grep "POST_NOTIFICATIONS" android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

## 🔑 Critical Changes Summary

### 🎵 **Audio Strategy Change** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Before**: Single audio file, auto-play in background
**After**: Two files - short alert in notification (15-30s), full adhan on tap only (60-120s)
**Why**: iOS/Android restrict long background audio, App Store may reject
**Impact**: Tasks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 all updated

### ⏰ **Android Exact Alarms** (CRITICAL)
**Before**: Standard notification scheduling
**After**: Request SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM and USE_EXACT_ALARM permissions
**Why**: Without this, notifications delayed 15-30 minutes by Doze mode
**Impact**: Tasks 1, 3, 5, 8, 9 updated with permission UI and functions

### 🔋 **Battery Optimization Guidance** (IMPORTANT)
**Before**: No battery guidance
**After**: UI section + button to open device battery settings
**Why**: OEMs (Samsung, Xiaomi) aggressively optimize, users need guidance
**Impact**: Tasks 3, 5, 8, 9 updated with guidance UI and translations

### 💾 **Prebuild Safety** (CRITICAL)
**Before**: No backup procedure
**After**: Backup android/ and google-services files BEFORE prebuild
**Why**: expo prebuild --clean can break Firebase configuration
**Impact**: Task 1 updated with bash commands and verification steps

### 📱 **Physical Device Testing** (MANDATORY)
**Before**: Not explicitly required
**After**: Physical device testing is MANDATORY, emulators insufficient
**Why**: Emulators don't simulate real notifications, Doze mode, battery optimization
**Impact**: Task 10 updated with explicit requirements and "Why Physical Devices Matter"

### 📅 **Day Change Detection** (IMPORTANT)
**Before**: Static scheduling
**After**: Track last schedule date, reschedule when day changes
**Why**: Prayer times change daily, notifications need rescheduling
**Impact**: Tasks 6, 7 updated with needsRescheduling() and foreground detection

### 🔔 **Cancel-Before-Reschedule** (CRITICAL)
**Before**: Not specified
**After**: ALWAYS cancel all notifications before scheduling new ones
**Why**: Prevents duplicate notifications
**Impact**: Task 6 updated with cancel-first logic

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**Reference Documents**:
1. **Quick solutions**: [CONCERNS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./CONCERNS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
2. **Code examples**: [UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../implementation/UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

4. **Diagrams**: [VISUAL_SUMMARY.md](./VISUAL_SUMMARY.md)

**Common Issues**:
- **Notifications not arriving**: Check exact alarm permission, battery optimization
- **Build fails after prebuild**: Restore from backup, check Google Services files
- **Audio not playing**: Verify two separate players, check volume settings
- **Emulator testing**: DON'T - use physical devices only

**Testing Problems**:
- **Delayed notifications**: Enable exact alarms, disable battery optimization
- **Duplicate notifications**: Verify cancel-before-reschedule logic
- **Wrong language**: Check i18n initialization, verify translation keys
